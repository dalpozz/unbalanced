Description: A dataset is said to be unbalanced when the class of interest (minority class) is much rarer than normal behaviour (majority class). The cost of missing a minority class is typically much higher that missing a majority class. Most learning systems are not prepared to cope with unbalanced data. Proposed strategies essentially belong to the following categories: sampling and distance-based. Sampling techniques up-sample or down-sample a class of instances. SMOTE generates synthetic minority examples. Distance based techniques use distances between input points to under-sample or to remove noisy and borderline examples.
